# ToDoQueue
Productivity tool

How to use:

Note: There are two options for using this repository

Option 1): You can download and run the precompiled executable jar files that I provide in the "Executable" folder. This is risky because you have no idea what is in that jar file, and your machine might be exposed to malware.

Option 2) (recomended): Downolad the "src" folder which contains the source code for the project. Then you can manually compile the java class files and run the newly made executable. I recommend this option because this how most open source projects expect you to use their repositories. Below is a step by step instructional to do this:

1. Make sure that you have the java JDK installed on your machine
2. Put the "src" directory in your desired installation location
3. Open "src" directory in a terminal/cmd window
4. On Windows type: install
   On Mac type: bash mymake.sh
5. Type: java ToDoQueue

And the program should run. Ez pz

This process is called manually compiling and running a java project.

Troubleshooting:
I may expand on this later but for now just ask me :)
